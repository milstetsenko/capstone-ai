### Capstone Project

This repo contains all the code for my Capstone Project: Creating Ukrainian Embroider Using Machine Learning.
The code for scraping images is here
The code for training and generating images using our custom StyleGAN is in the corresponding `.ipynb` files since I did most of the work using Google Collab for its ease of use and good pricing.
Model itself was trained on P100 GPU from Google Collab.

Here is a short gif that shows how our model morphs generated images into one another
